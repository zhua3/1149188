    "# Project Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- Columns to keep or drop\n",
    "    - Columns to keep are: \"uniq_id\", \"product_name\", \"price\", \"number_available_in_stock\", \"number_of_reviews\", \"average_review_rating\", \"amazon_category_and_sub_category\", \"product_information\", \"customer_reviews\" and \"seller\".\n",
    "    - I will drop \"manufacturer\" because it contains too much random and inaccurate information, such as numbers or repeated words from the product name, which makes it impossible to clean. \n",
    "    - I will drop \"number_of_answered_questions\" since the numbers don’t give any meaningful insight (the actual questions are unknown).\n",
    "    - I will drop \"customers_who_bought_this_item_also_bought\" and \"items_customers_buy_after_viewing_this_item\" because they only contain product web links, and most of them are likely invalid as the dataset is quite old.\n",
    "    - I will drop \"description\" and \"product_description\" because they are long paragraphs with similar content, and it is hard to extract clear, representative keywords from them.\n",
    "    - I will drop \"customer_questions_and_answers\" because only 914 out of 10,000 rows are filled, and the filled ones contain long paragraphs that are difficult to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean data \n",
    "    - For \"price\", remove symbols before the number.\n",
    "    - For \"number_available_in_stock\", split into two columns: \"stock_quantity\" and \"stock_status\".\n",
    "    - From \"average_review_rating\", extract the numeric part into a new column called \"average_rating\".\n",
    "    - For \"amazon_category_and_sub_category\", split into two levels only, and label them \"main_category\" and \"sub_category\".\n",
    "    - From \"product_information\", extract product weight (e.g., values like weight…g or weight…kg) into a new column called \"product_weight\".\n",
    "    - For \"product_weight\":\n",
    "        - extract only numbers and g/kg,\n",
    "        - convert all g values into kg,\n",
    "        - remove the unit (e.g., kg).\n",
    "    - From \"product_information\", also extract age suitability (e.g., age…up) into a new column called \"age_suitability\", and keep only the numeric part.\n",
    "    - From \"customer_reviews\", extract the first date into a new column called \"purchase_date\" (assuming reviews were made in the same month as purchase).\n",
    "    - From \"seller\", extract only the seller name.\n",
    "    - Fix the data type for each feature.\n",
    "    - For all string columns, use .strip() to remove leading and trailing spaces.\n",
    "    - Drop the original features after transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transform data\n",
    "    - Filling missing value\n",
    "        - For categories, use \"Unknown main category\" and \"Unknown sub category\".\n",
    "        - For \"price\", fill with the average price of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"stock_quantity\", fill with the mode of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"stock_status\", fill with the mode of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"product_weight\", fill with the median of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"age_suitability\", fill with the mode of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"purchase_date\", fill with the mode of the same sub_category.\n",
    "        - For \"number_of_reviews\", fill with the mode of the same sub_category.\n",

         "SET : PLAYMOBIL 5494 'CHRISTMAS ADVENT 2015' // 5.0 // 5 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    ДД²\n  \n on 5 Dec. 2015 // ★ PLAYMOBIL★ 5494★ 2015★ AGE GUIDE : 4-10 (Not for children under 3 years)★ 101 pc★ Assembly instruction booklet includedI always pop a chunky advent calendar in my basket to have from Amazon, and when the price decreases (which is usually the case); I place the order, which happened in October this year.The colourful, quality box measures around 40 cm x 30 cm x 8 cm overall and comes in a strong outer carton for safe transit.◄ SPOILER ALERT! ►Like a box of crackers, the box has a cardboard overlay detailing the contents, day-by-day, which I have gone on to show in my images to give an idea of the content this year.  I discard this layer when giving as a gift so the recipient doesn’t  know what to expect behind each window.  If it is opened carefully, there is no evidence of this.Underneath, on one side of the box is a tree-framed, snowy scene with a path meandering off into the distance with an inbuilt hanger to put on a wall, if required.  If just standing the calendar on a flat surface, which is quite successful due to its depth, the hanger just looks like the moon in the wintry night sky and doesn’t spoil the scene.On the other side are the advent calendar windows, showing Santa & his elves, busy with preparations and loading the sleigh, watched over by an angel.  The windows vary in sizes and the numbers are easy to spot, each surrounded by a bright yellow star.  They are relatively easy to open, by depressing and pushing back on the tab, and then tear the perforations.  The rewards occasionally need basic assembling, adding to the fun.The contents are designed to go on the colourful backdrop – the base of which measures around 46 cm maximum x 24.Read more › | She was absolutely delighted when I gave it to her on 30th November ... // 5.0 // 23 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    Diane R\n  \n on 23 Jan. 2015 // My 7 year old granddaughter asked for this having seen it in a shop window and found from some friends at school that they had had one last year.

Out of the 24 boxes in the calendar we felt we only got about 6 quality items and we felt the rest of it was like items from Kinder eggs.  There were only 4 actual Playmobile figures in the whole pack.  We did use the opening of the advent calendar doors as a bribe after tooth brushing which has really helped us.  We're going to try the Lego calendar next year. | Beautifully detailed, an annual purchase from now on // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    Cookieland\n  \n on 29 Dec. 2015 // My sister made me an advent calendar back in 2004 out of matchboxes, papier mache and the Playmobil nativity sets, after all this time it is getting rather battered and loved but my two young children adore it. I was delighted to discover Playmobil made their own calendars a few years ago but at the time the price was out of my range and I didn't think it looked like you got much inside for the price. How wrong was I! On the spur of the moment I ordered this the last week of November, my husband was not impressed when he realized I had spent nearly £25 on an advent calendar/Seasonal toy. However when it arrived one look on the back of the box swayed him. Note: Don't let the recipients of the calendar see the back of the box for it shows you what you receive behind each door! Each door holds something for Santa's workshop, e.g a blue basket with six teeny tiny animal figures (When I say teeny, I mean teeny! About half a cm in size. My five year old took to carrying them around in his pocket he was so delighted with them), a wheelbarrow and teddy bear, carrots for the reindeer, a \"present\" with toy racing car. There are four little card boxes behind various doors which you need to fold up into presents. This advent calendar comes with four figures - An angel, two elves and Santa himself (Who also comes with his list and quill on 24th), all hidden behind a different door. Inside the box there is a beautiful cardboard backdrop, you have to pop out some parts and fold it to make it stand. It really is gorgeous and the children loved setting up the scene each day. The card game you get is just a little box with a simple game of snap (Or pairs) inside. I think my children would have preferred an extra toy for the grotto but it is a nice idea. I will definitely be buying these annually. The excitement on my bairns faces each morning was wonderful and something you would not be able to get from a chocolate calendar. Plus they have a beautiful toy to get out every Christmas. | We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together ... // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    MrsM\n  \n on 31 Dec. 2014 // First time I have bought one. We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together especially with small kids, but I managed it by only really letting them play with it Xmas eve when it was complete (mean mum). The doors are quite firm so smaller kids need a bit of effort to open them. I had to open the door for my 3 year old to break the perforations then close it for her to open in the morning. As I have all the bits, it may be back again next year and I can mix up all the pieces for them. I will be looking to see what other ones there are too.",

I discard this layer when giving as a gift so the recipient doesn’t  know what to expect behind each window.  If it is opened carefully, there is no evidence of this.Underneath, on one side of the box is a tree-framed, snowy scene with a path meandering off into the distance with an inbuilt hanger to put on a wall, if required.  If just standing the calendar on a flat surface, which is quite successful due to its depth, the hanger just looks like the moon in the wintry night sky and doesn’t spoil the scene.On the other side are the advent calendar windows, showing Santa & his elves, busy with preparations and loading the sleigh, watched over by an angel.  The windows vary in sizes and the numbers are easy to spot, each surrounded by a bright yellow star.  They are relatively easy to open, by depressing and pushing back on the tab, and then tear the perforations.  The rewards occasionally need basic assembling, adding to the fun.The contents are designed to go on the colourful backdrop – the base of which measures around 46 cm maximum x 24.Read more › | She was absolutely delighted when I gave it to her on 30th November ... // 5.0 // 23 Jan. 2015 // By\n    \n    Diane R\n  \n on 23 Jan. 2015 // My 7 year old granddaughter asked for this having seen it in a shop window and found from some friends at school that they had had one last year.

We're going to try the Lego calendar next year. | Beautifully detailed, an annual purchase from now on // 5.0 // 29 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    Cookieland\n  \n on 29 Dec. 2015 // My sister made me an advent calendar back in 2004 out of matchboxes, papier mache and the Playmobil nativity sets, after all this time it is getting rather battered and loved but my two young children adore it. I was delighted to discover Playmobil made their own calendars a few years ago but at the time the price was out of my range and I didn't think it looked like you got much inside for the price. How wrong was I! On the spur of the moment I ordered this the last week of November, my husband was not impressed when he realized I had spent nearly £25 on an advent calendar/Seasonal toy. However when it arrived one look on the back of the box swayed him. Note: Don't let the recipients of the calendar see the back of the box for it shows you what you receive behind each door! Each door holds something for Santa's workshop, e.g a blue basket with six teeny tiny animal figures (When I say teeny, I mean teeny! About half a cm in size. My five year old took to carrying them around in his pocket he was so delighted with them), a wheelbarrow and teddy bear, carrots for the reindeer, a \"present\" with toy racing car. There are four little card boxes behind various doors which you need to fold up into presents. This advent calendar comes with four figures - An angel, two elves and Santa himself (Who also comes with his list and quill on 24th), all hidden behind a different door. Inside the box there is a beautiful cardboard backdrop, you have to pop out some parts and fold it to make it stand. It really is gorgeous and the children loved setting up the scene each day. The card game you get is just a little box with a simple game of snap (Or pairs) inside. I think my children would have preferred an extra toy for the grotto but it is a nice idea. I will definitely be buying these annually. The excitement on my bairns faces each morning was wonderful and something you would not be able to get from a chocolate calendar. Plus they have a beautiful toy to get out every Christmas. | We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together ... // 5.0 // 31 Dec. 2014 // By\n    \n    MrsM\n  \n on 31 Dec. 2014 // First time I have bought one. We all loved it. Bit tricky keeping all the bits together especially with small kids, but I managed it by only really letting them play with it Xmas eve when it was complete (mean mum). The doors are quite firm so smaller kids need a bit of effort to open them. I had to open the door for my 3 year old to break the perforations then close it for her to open in the morning. As I have all the bits, it may be back again next year and I can mix up all the pieces for them. I will be looking to see what other ones there are too.",

Wholly plastic toys are made by a process called \"injection moulding\". This toy appears to 90% plastic.

         "It's amazing! // 5.0 // 12 Sept. 2015 // By\n    \n    G Shipman\n  \n on 12 Sept. 2015 // I very rarely bother to write reviews but felt I had to for this one particularly as one of the existing views doesn't paint a fair picture.I've had a few of these and this is the best I've experienced yet. For £17 it's simply amazing. The build quality is better than one I spent twice as much on! I was attracted by how small it is and wasn't disappointed. It is true that this does limit the time the battery lasts for, but 4 mins is a fair assessment. I don't think you could expect more for anything so impressively small!It does take a little bit of practice. You're flying a four channel aircraft in your living room after all but it's gyros our well setup and as forgiving as they possibly could be. I was particularly impressed by the additional features that you'd normally have to pay a lot more for. It has trim on three of the channels; two sensitivity settings; a 3D flight mode enabling se impressive flips; and a self righting system so you can throw it into the air upside down and it'll sort itself out.For £17 it can't be beaten. | XT FQ777 124 Pocket Drone // 5.0 // 6 Feb. 2016 // By\n    \n    sedov\n  \n on 6 Feb. 2016 // Excellent service from the provider of this product  well pleased - The product itself takes some time to set up as the instructions can be hard to follow as there small in size - Once trimmed its a fine piece of kit last about 3 to 4 minutes / It comes with attachments that I recommend you fit as the blades are femma and can break if flown into any surface also continuous charging and flying over time will burn out the micro motors the drone will function but will not take off when this happens. Overall its a great drone if respected for a beginner old or young and for the price a bargain | Robust Fun but with the normal hit and miss instruction booklet // 4.0 // 24 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    Amazon Customer\n  \n on 24 Mar. 2016 // Pretty much what I was expecting, with a few little niggles but once sorted it seems to be good value for money.First snag was the charging lead didn't fit, I think there should be a notch at the top of the charging port to locate the lead it was easier to cut the lugs off the charging lead than to make a notch in the cove of the port, the connector is a one way fit only but small enough that BFI could fit it the wrong way.The rotor guard isn't the easiest thing to fit but it does its job, even after it got broken by my wife sitting on it whilst it was charging, the only thing that did so its quite robust.The instruction book...It isn't exactly right, the light stop flashing when it is paired and start to flash slowly as the flight battery runs out. Pairing hmmm Initially I couldn't get it too so I tried to change the mode, this resulted in it taking off and crashing int the ceiling when I tried to pair it afterwards I still haven't worked out the sequence properly, and it has to be done every time you charge it, annoying but worth  messing with. It seems to remember the trim setting a whilst charging which is a good thing as the small size of the controller makes this a bit fiddly a more ergonomic controller would make it nicer, but less portable so swings and roundabouts therelastly a lose hair bit of fluff or a spiders web is enough to slow the motors down and mess up the trim, This is true in my experience of all small copters, but it is a simple matter to remove the blade the hair and refit the blade. | Very happy // 5.0 // 7 Jan. 2016 // By\n    \n    Kath\n  \n on 7 Jan. 2016 // Very happy, will shop again Thank you | Short flight time // 1.0 // 15 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    Amazon Customer\n  \n on 15 Mar. 2016 // This is a decent product but a major problem with it is the flight time I am getting, it is horrendous its says about 5 minutes in the description but I only get a maximum of 25 seconds before the battery dies. The suppliers are totally unresponsive as well if you send them a return request. I'm sure the flight time problem will affect a lot of these quadcopters but also there will be a lot of good ones as well, but the quality is really inconsistent. | Great product but... // 4.0 // 21 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    Casey\n  \n on 21 Mar. 2016 // I was very impressed with this product and it flies really well . I really like the way the remote can house everything. However  I ordered 3 , one for me  and one each for my siblings , and mine works fine but the other two's stopped working after one crash so just be aware of that when buying . | Fantastic little machine // 5.0 // 13 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Les H\n  \n on 13 Oct. 2015 // Fantastic little machine that I'm using for fun and to practice to get for my bigger drone that's on its way in a few weeks time.

         "Perfect first semi-grownup train set. // 5.0 // 23 Mar. 2013 // By\n    \n    Matthew Wilson\n  \n on 23 Mar. 2013 // I bought this for my 4 year old nephew as a first semi-grownup train set.  He absolutely loved it and was a total hit on his birthday.  Has plenty of track pieces and easy operation of switch tracks.  I wasn’t overly impressed with the so called ‘auto loader’, as it’s not physically attached to the relevant track piece, it just kind of floats free.  However, the auto stop feature works very well.  The trains can be a little fiddly to couple together and keep on the track at times, but are more than robust enough to withstand a 4 year old.  After a few hours he was swapping the train cars around and easily putting them back on the track when they became derailed.  The actual train motor has two speeds on it. Allowing for easier play and longer battery life (when it’s going slower).  Battery life using a mix of both speeds was easily 6 hours. | 5 yr old likes this // 4.0 // 9 Jan. 2014 // By\n    \n    Becky\n  \n on 9 Jan. 2014 // My 5 yr old really wanted this when saw it on the telly so we got it for him for xmas. He puts it together himself, and spends a good while fiddling about with it. Not very robust feeling, but so far nothing broken, and at age 5 he is reasonably careful. He likes it, so overall a good buy. Also it was the only freight train we could find that wasn't really expensive like Playmobil. | Fab train set- 6 year old grandson loved it- v easy to change track layout and plenty ... // 5.0 // 9 Aug. 2014 // By\n    \n    Johno\n  \n on 9 Aug. 2014 // Fab train set- 6 year old grandson loved it- v easy to change track layout and plenty of accesories. Well worth the money. | A lovely train set. // 5.0 // 2 Jun. 2015 // By\n    \n    P. Sherrington\n  \n on 2 Jun. 2015 // This is great value for money. It was bought for a young lad with ADHD.  He has played and played with it. Yes it is plastic, but it is quite flexible, so the track has been stood on and not broken.  The car loader is fantastic.  The points work brilliantly.  Other than the train being knocked off the track it has never once come off on its own.  I can only assume others have not got the knack of getting the track to clip together properly (there is a knack to it).I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Even our 20 year old son spent time playing with it!.We did have to make a slight modification to the engine.  There is a piece of plastic on the bottom of the battery compartment that kept fouling on the points and stopping the train.  We shaved that off with a knife and off it went. | Power trains perfect // 5.0 // 29 July 2014 // By\n    \n    WaveyDavey\n  \n on 29 July 2014 // Terrific value for our grandchildren.

However, I actually bought them to add some sparkle to my home made computer greetings cards at Christmas.I wasn't expecting them to work as well as the traditional glue on paper, sprinkle glitter, shake off method but they actually worked much better.The easy to hold pen design allows for greater definition and control for the placement of lovely sparkly glitter. They come in some really beautiful colours and once dry (takes about 2 hours or so to be totally dry) can create some stunning effects.

Everything is chunky and well-made. Where the vehicles have been painted, the colours are bright and appealing, but it's nice to see that some sections retain their natural wood effect.

These stacking vehicles are no different but I do prefer the Train which we have and have given as a gift twice and always becomes a firm favourite.

However, through the cellophane it looks like a sturdy, well constructed toy. It looks larger than I thought it would be and I think the 2.5 year old boy we bought it for will love it! My daughter has the Melissa and Doug stacking train, which is really good quality and an excellent toy too | Ought to buy it again. // 5.0 // 27 April 2013 // By\n    \n    Lunareef\n  \n on 27 April 2013 // I bought these for a friends child but wish I had bought them for mine too as they are lovely.

         "Syma S032G - Great If You Have Enough Space // 4.0 // 9 Oct. 2011 // By\n    \n    Honest Joe\n  \n on 9 Oct. 2011 // **Updated 20 October 2012**The first S032G is still going strong, and is so good to fly outdoors occasionaly (in ZERO wind) that I have ordered a second helicopter.  The price has just dipped, so good opportunity to buy a second heli.  This way I should always have spare parts to keep one heli operational; the cost of individual spare parts (blades, batteries, motors) can be far more than the cost of the entire new helicopter.  The S032G has a few glitches (occasional loss of power in flight), but these helis are such good value for the money and can be used outdoors where you can have much more freedom to control them with ease (in zero wind).After the passage of time/more practice, I find the S032G is actually very controllable indoors but is rather too cramped even in a moderate inside area.  For me, this is partially because I avoid flight over objects that might get damaged (or damage it) if it falls out of the air!  I have avoided the larger S031G as I think it will get no use indoors, and outdoors would probably require a trek out to the nearest field.If you like the S032G, seriously consider the S036G - that is a similar size and a very nicely detailed version of the Bell AH-1 Cobra.  Check out my review of that helicopter, it is more expensive, and having a similar radio system is also subject to the occasional loss of power in flight - so operate it wisely.OK these helicopters are not as 'fancy' as a 4 channel helicopter, but what they lack in a fourth channel (sideways movement), they make up for in sheer robustness, value and serviceability.  I can buy a second S032G AND S036G (and just have!) for LESS than than a comparable sized four channel; which by the way will probably get broken as soon as you look at it in a funny way!Read more › | Excellent beginner helicopter - pity about the battery... // 4.0 // 6 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    Daniel James\n  \n on 6 Jan. 2011 // This helicopter is a tonne of fun - period !The only issue is the battery life which is pretty bad.The flight time is around 6 minutes and that feels like its gone in 2 minutes (time really does fly when you are having fun).The package doesn't include any spare blades just the rotor and there is no USB charge cable either, which is a shame.The helicopter is still a great present for your child though and will make him/her want to have a go at the next step in RC heli's or planes. | Very good product but let down with poor radio equipment // 4.0 // 30 Aug. 2011 // By\n    \n    C. James\n  \n on 30 Aug. 2011 // i have had this helicopter for about a year now and it has been great for indoor and outdoor flying, when it isnt windy! it is very easy to fly even for beginners and i was very impressed with its build quality! one thing you must be aware of though is this helicopter uses 27MHz radio equipment, this is very basic and you will have times were interference will disrupt your radio link and the helicopter will just fall out the sky but thankfully this does not happen very often and the good build quality will reduce damage during a crash, overall i would say that this is a good buy for beginners and pros! | SYMA S032 Gyro 3ch Radio Controlled helicopter // 5.0 // 3 Jan. 2011 // By\n    \n    J.

It's a bit too big to fly indoors for long so i'm waiting for the weather to change in order to try it fully. The only downside is the quality of the instructions which have been very badly translated into English.

Went for this one as the reveiws were really good and quite a lot of the bits on it were made of metal, so I thought it would be more robust.It certainly seems to be lasting longer than his last helicopter. Nice design, style and colour options. | Lovely toy // 4.0 // 7 Aug. 2013 // By\n    \n    Robin Bragg\n  \n on 7 Aug. 2013 // Only downside is the time charging, flies for 10-12 minutes tho, love it, flew it outdoors too even thought it is an indoor helicopter. | Fab Present // 5.0 // 15 Oct. 2013 // By\n    \n    Zoe Barrick\n  \n on 15 Oct. 2013 // Bought this as a present, really durable!

This is not his first helicopter (which was pretty poor). His dream is to fly a good helicopter. As Santa will be delivering this I have charged it up and flown it to make sure he will not be disappointed. First impression when getting it out of the box was \"Wow, well made!\"  When pressing the power button this little thing flips into the air and as long as you are gentle with the controls is so agile it is almost too good to be true. To turn left/right a simple stroke of the control and off it goes with pinpoint accuracy. This toy is a delight to fly and within minutes I had it doing all sorts of stuff around the living room. It hovers with ease, forward and backward control is all so simple. I am so delighted he is going to LOVE this!!  Having flown it don't be put of by the 14+ on the box, I know my son will easily fly this. Because of it's lightweight frame and electronics the only thing I will not let him do with it is the re-charging (tiny fragile plug). I also love the ability to charge it from a computer or USB 240v socket which will save his control batteries for flight. I cannot recommend this helicopter highly enough it is amazing value for money............. just get one!! | helicopter // 5.0 // 1 Feb. 2013 // By\n    \n    sandra sleightholme\n  \n on 1 Feb. 2013 // excellent toy and great gift. well made, durable and strong which is just as well as I crash it regularly! | Excellent, bargain // 5.0 // 27 Jun. 2013 // By\n    \n    Martyn\n  \n on 27 Jun. 2013 // My 8 year old nephew loved it, ME TOO! tho crashed a few times it's quite robust and blades are easy to replace. | ... difficult to master but provides a lot of INDOOR fun. Don't use it in the garden // 4.0 // 9 Nov. 2014 // By\n    \n    Dave Fennessy\n  \n on 9 Nov. 2014 // Quite difficult to master but provides a lot of INDOOR fun. Don't use it in the garden, it simply doesn't have any resistance to air movement. Constant USB battery charging is a pain but then it has to be a small light battery or it wouldn't get off the ground. Took a lot of crash damage onto laminated flooring but finally smashed into pieces after about 5 days. We expected as much. Be prepared to buy constant spare parts or save up for a more robust flying machine. | Remote control helicopter // 5.0 // 15 Feb. 2014 // By\n    \n    michelle\n  \n on 15 Feb. 2014 // My 6 year old son absolutely loved this for his birthday.....& so dose my biggest boy (my HUSBAND)!!

For £17 it's simply amazing. The build quality is better than one I spent twice as much on! I was attracted by how small it is and wasn't disappointed. It is true that this does limit the time the battery lasts for, but 4 mins is a fair assessment. I don't think you could expect more for anything so impressively small!It does take a little bit of practice. You're flying a four channel aircraft in your living room after all but it's gyros our well setup and as forgiving as they possibly could be. I was particularly impressed by the additional features that you'd normally have to pay a lot more for. It has trim on three of the channels; two sensitivity settings; a 3D flight mode enabling se impressive flips; and a self righting system so you can throw it into the air upside down and it'll sort itself out.For £17 it can't be beaten. | XT FQ777 124 Pocket Drone // 5.0 // 6 Feb. 2016 // By\n    \n    sedov\n  \n on 6 Feb. 2016 // Excellent service from the provider of this product  well pleased - The product itself takes some time to set up as the instructions can be hard to follow as there small in size - Once trimmed its a fine piece of kit last about 3 to 4 minutes / It comes with attachments that I recommend you fit as the blades are femma and can break if flown into any surface also continuous charging and flying over time will burn out the micro motors the drone will function but will not take off when this happens. Overall its a great drone if respected for a beginner old or young and for the price a bargain | Very happy // 5.0 // 7 Jan. 2016 // By\n    \n    Kath\n  \n on 7 Jan. 2016 // Very happy, will shop again Thank you | Short flight time // 1.0 // 15 Mar. 2016 // By\n    \n    Amazon Customer\n  \n on 15 Mar. 2016 // This is a decent product but a major problem with it is the flight time I am getting, it is horrendous its says about 5 minutes in the description but I only get a maximum of 25 seconds before the battery dies. The suppliers are totally unresponsive as well if you send them a return request. I'm sure the flight time problem will affect a lot of these quadcopters but also there will be a lot of good ones as well, but the quality is really inconsistent. | Fantastic little machine // 5.0 // 13 Oct. 2015 // By\n    \n    Les H\n  \n on 13 Oct. 2015 // Fantastic little machine that I'm using for fun and to practice to get for my bigger drone that's on its way in a few weeks time.

I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By\n    \n    richard\n  \n on 11 April 2015 // Amazing detail, every credit to the photographer in this book, a worthy reference manual, as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains. | 'Great Purchase' // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By\n    \n    Pinkhandbag\n  \n on 23 April 2014 // This was purchased on behalf of my Dad.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By\n    \n    richard\n  \n on 11 April 2015 // Amazing detail, every credit to the photographer in this book, a worthy reference manual, as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains. | 'Great Purchase' // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By\n    \n    Pinkhandbag\n  \n on 23 April 2014 // This was purchased on behalf of my Dad.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesn't cost much at all! | Excellent product // 5.0 // 29 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    Trevor\n  \n on 29 Jun. 2014 // Excellent product everybody should have one or to of product  excellent  100 percent ok speedy delivery excellent i give it five stars CLASSIC TOY TRAIN SET TRACK CARRIAGES LIGHT ENGINE BOXED BOYS KIDS BATTERYdouble aa battery goes in top of engine | Review book finding love again // 5.0 // 20 Aug. 2015 // By\n    \n    Janet\n  \n on 20 Aug. 2015 // I was extremely pleased with the train set really good value for money. | I would not recommend this item // 1.0 // 11 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    ann milburn\n  \n on 11 Dec. 2015 // i found this item, not suitable for young children,  very difficult to keep the carriages together and the whole thing kept coming off the track.All very thin plastic.

I've still got my old ones dating back to the 70s and 80s somewhere.  These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By\n    \n    richard\n  \n on 11 April 2015 // Amazing detail, every credit to the photographer in this book, a worthy reference manual, as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains. | 'Great Purchase' // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By\n    \n    Pinkhandbag\n  \n on 23 April 2014 // This was purchased on behalf of my Dad.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains.

These days the catalogue is especially informative in that it tells you the vintage of the rolling stock which is useful if you are dedicating your railway to one particular era and train company. | Amazing detail fabulous photography. // 5.0 // 11 April 2015 // By\n    \n    richard\n  \n on 11 April 2015 // Amazing detail, every credit to the photographer in this book, a worthy reference manual, as well as a sales brochure. even if you only have a passing interest in the hobby you will be transported to another time when we were all younger and in awe of the big trains. | 'Great Purchase' // 5.0 // 23 April 2014 // By\n    \n    Pinkhandbag\n  \n on 23 April 2014 // This was purchased on behalf of my Dad.

His mouth dropped open with surprise! (no joke, it literally did!)It's very easy to connect the plastic track/assemble, it takes 2 mins. It's very easy to connect the trains together and apply to track.All you need is two AA batteries and time to watch your child enjoy themselves!We even added homemade tunnels to this to make it more fun, we simply cut holes in cardboard boxes to put around certain parts of the track!This is brilliant for very young kids if they're very interested in trains. This gets them started in the hobby and doesn't cost much at all! | Excellent product // 5.0 // 29 Jun. 2014 // By\n    \n    Trevor\n  \n on 29 Jun. 2014 // Excellent product everybody should have one or to of product  excellent  100 percent ok speedy delivery excellent i give it five stars CLASSIC TOY TRAIN SET TRACK CARRIAGES LIGHT ENGINE BOXED BOYS KIDS BATTERYdouble aa battery goes in top of engine | Review book finding love again // 5.0 // 20 Aug. 2015 // By\n    \n    Janet\n  \n on 20 Aug. 2015 // I was extremely pleased with the train set really good value for money. | I would not recommend this item // 1.0 // 11 Dec. 2015 // By\n    \n    ann milburn\n  \n on 11 Dec. 2015 // i found this item, not suitable for young children,  very difficult to keep the carriages together and the whole thing kept coming off the track.All very thin plastic.
